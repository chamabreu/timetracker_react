# Timetracker

09:00 - 09:30: Understanding and Set Up for Project (Picture #1)
09:30 - Start Coding

09:30 - 10:17: Setup React App and working on Task 1 -> Counter (Renamed from TimeTracker)


10:17 - 12:15: Task 2 -> Coding
10:17 - 10:22: Task 2 -> Whiteboard Layout (Picture #2)

10:22 - 10:54: Fighting with JS Date and formatting - bypassing it now and just save the seconds from Date.now()

10:54 - 11:41: Order Components for Task 2 - maybe using useContext or useReducer to update child components from Parent?!
Struggling on Reset Counter from Top
Pausing this and going to Backend

11:41 - 11:55: Node Backend Init and basic Routes working. Mongoose Connection established
11:55 - 12:15: Setting axios and Routes - 12:15 first Task is saved.

12:15 - 13:00: Break


13:00 - 14:11: Task 3 - Recordings
13:00 - 13:12: Whiteboard Layout (Picture #3)
13:12 - 13:43: API Call for all Tasks and List them
13:43 - 14:06: Implemented search for descriptions
14:06 - 14:11: Pagination - never done something like this, going for research to check if i should first optimize the application or continue this task.
Discovered that Bootstrap has a Pagination Component.
Skipping this step and go optimizing the App.

14:11 - : Optimizing Process
Tasks:
- 14:11 - 15:00: better and cleaner UI
- 15:00 - 15:30: Counter logic now depends on Date.now() to ensure a stable time measurement
- 15:30 - 15:50: Shifted TaskCounter up to be able to reset Counter on Tasktracker
- 15:50 - 16:20: Updated Timeview in Tasktracker and Recordings. Now the Time and Date is good to read. User Feedback for Saving implemented.
- 16:20 - 16:40: Implementing Table in Recordings. First Time I used a table from Bootstrap. Worked fine.

16:40 Finishing up for Distribution
