# Extending the Project

## The Roadmap

### Global

- Host the Webpage live for quick access and showcase
- Docker implementation - never worked with Docker. So learning is first Task.
- Documentation
- Give tasks a creator-name, to show who did a Task. People share the list for now.
  - Longterm would be to give different logins for personal lists

### Frontend

- ~~Sorting Recordings from new to old~~
- "Autostart" or Reminder for the Counter.
- Statemanagement. Try useContext() and/or useReducer() or maybe Redux.
- Delete option to delete Tasks from Database
- Pagination. (Alternative to Pagination a Datatable module, if exist?!)
- Show Dates a bit nicer with weeknames and other format, example => Wed 06.01.2021, 15:45:02

### Backend
- Errorhandling, res.send() with more Details, etc...
- Option to use a Ã¶ocal MongoDB
